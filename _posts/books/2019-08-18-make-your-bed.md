Make your bed is a book by Admiral William H. McRaven a retired navy SEAL, based on his university wide commencement address titled the same, given in 2014 at UT Austin. The book is short and crisp with 10 key life lessons that the author emphasizes, and these are pretty much the key takeaways from the book. These are documented below for my personal record, but reading below will definitely spoil any intentions to get new revelations while actually reading the book.

1. Start off by making your bed - “If you want to change the world, start off your day by making your bed.” It helps to get a good start to the day, and you can count on it as being the first task you successfully close in the day.
2. Find someone to help you paddle - If you want to change the world, teamwork is key, and your success always depends on others.
3. Measure a person by the size of their heart, not the size of their flippers - The idea that grit is more important than talent, was a lesson during training to the author, and applies to other walks of life.
4. Get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward - With interesting examples of his fellow Navy seals and friends, the section contains a galvanizing narrative of a cyclist getting unfortunately paralyzed, and not complaining once for 35 years! The idea driven home is to get over misfortunes and mishappenings, and to just look ahead.
5. Don’t be afraid of the circuses - Referring to circuses, the brutal calisthenics-punishment sessions that broke many SEAL recruits, the author addresses the fear of failure and how to overcome it.
6. Sometimes you have to slide down the obstacle head first - “You must dare gently. Those who live in fear of failure or hardship or embarrassment will never realize their full potential.” Taking calculated risks is a must, and shouldn’t be sidelined.
7. Don’t back down from the sharks - “Stand up to the bullies. Bullies are all the same. Whether they are in a schoolyard, workplace or ruling a country through terror, they all thrive on fear and intimidation.”
8. You must be your very best in the darkest moment - “Find your courage. Dig deep and you will find it in abundance.” Rising to the occasion is key, when times are tough.
9. Start singing when you’re up to your neck in mud - ”Giving hope can be extremely powerful. With hope, you can raise the downtrodden, you can ease the pain of an unbearable loss.”
10. Don’t ever, ever ring the bell - Refuse to give up on your dreams. Blaming current circumstances on someone else isn’t going to help.
