Being one of the most impactful and best selling science fiction novels of the 20th century, ‘2001 A Space Odyssey’ is quite the must read classic for all sci-fi buffs. The structure of the novel is more like a main story narrated as an anthology of smaller stories - each having a rising action, climax, and falling action.

It starts out with the first couple of chapters painting a somber image of our ancestors. With moon-watcher - a tribesman being the main character in this section, the story describes a tribe of hunters and gatherers encountering a large monolith - possibly of alien origin, called the new rock. Beginnings of analytical thought among these primitive beings are seen when moon-watcher interacts with the new rock making deductions and forming a theory on how it may have come to be.

In subsequent chapters, the book follows two astronauts - Dr. Bowman and Dr. Poole on their journey to Saturn on a mission called Discovery One. <span class="spoiler">With a mistaken diagnosis from the spaceship’s AI - HAL9000, the story takes a deep turn into a nerve wracking showdown between man and machine.</span> The mysterious monolith from the initial chapters makes appearances in many subsequent chapters too, and is central to the whole plot.

References to suspended animation of some of the astronauts en-route to Saturn, and the interactions with AI computer HAL9000 seemed like content straight out of a Star Trek episode! Or the author taking about the uselessness of the human appendix reminded me of Spock’s similar ideas while comparing the human appendix to his vulkan ears!

The book and 1968 movie narratives are also extremely comparable. In fact reading the book gives a better understanding of the movie although scenes from Kubrick’s movie would surely play in the back of your head if you watch the film first and then read the book. During my read, I always marveled at the kind of space lingo I encountered in the book like extravehicular pods in spaceships, monoliths, white dwarf stars, star-gates, star-children, and mentions of many other real/fantastical interstellar objects - all of which seems quite ahead of its time keeping in mind the book was published in the 1960s. The story somehow manages to always surround the reader with an aura of mystery and offers a chance for you to leave with a new found fascination for space, space travel and stuff that might be in store for humanity if we look beyond our current reach.

Overall, Arthur C. Clarke was quite the titanic visionary in the sci-fi genre and he manages to express his foretelling yet daunting imagination in this book, that’s been quite passionately read in the audio-version to keep the audience engaged. On one hand, reading it in 2020 feels kind-of redundant when weighed up against any of the countless other books/movies/tv shows in this genre between 1968 and 2020 including the Martian, Gravity, Interstellar, Firefly, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars. But on the other hand, the book is definitely a timeless classic, and a nice add-on to your “finished must-reads” bookshelf!

PS: I was thrilled to see the effect of the 1968 book, even in 2020 pop-culture!! :)
