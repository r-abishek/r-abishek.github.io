All the stuff you wish they had taught you in school, all the stuff about the history of human civilization, evolution and the development of science and technology as we know it today, all the stuff about the big bang theory, the inflationary theory, the extraordinary conditions that forged the universe we know of today, all the stuff about the theory of evolution, the origins of life on earth up until the dawn of humanity and human civilization we live in today - This book presents to the reader/listener an awe-inspiring panoramic view of the thousands of years of evolution, and the extreme ephemerality of humans, if put on the cosmic scale. It is a great read, and the audiobook is narrated in quite an engaging tone that makes the listener marvel at the whole history of life on our planet and create a spark of curiosity within one's self into what else might be in store for further discovery. Every scientist you may have ever heard of in high school or later would probably have their spot in this book, along with either an interesting story or a mention of some of their most important contributions to science - Newton, Einstein, Mendeleev, Hubble, Rutherford, Planck, Darwin and many many more.

Bryson talks about the expansion and acceleration of the universe, the billions of other known galaxies and the hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way galaxy, discoveries that were attributed to the invention of standard candles - an ingenious way to measure relative distances between galaxies. The author touches upon the superstring theory - which suggests our physical space to be in 10 dimensions (3D + time + 6D hyperspace) which is an attempt to harmonize Einsteinâ€™s theory of general relativity (for large-scale) with quantum mechanics (theory of the atomic/small) - a problem that has intrigued physicists for a hundred years.

In subsequent chapters Bryson dives into biology and anthropology. The book talks about the Cambrian explosion, the 5 major extinctions including the Permian and Triassic extinctions, the multiple ice ages and describes the the big-birth, which is the origin and birth of microbes that eventually evolved into more advanced forms of life. Delving into the major areas of work by scientists in the 19th and 20h century gives the reader a brief about the specific evidence supporting the claim/discovery and a general understanding of the process of natural selection, and eventually the biological evolution of humans from bipeds, hominids and Neanderthals.

The book cautions us on how not to endanger our own survival and that of other species and gives countless other discussions on remarkable inventions, interesting stories and examples of successes from the past, that every one of us should have the curiosity to know about. A highly recommended read at any age to expand your knowledge quotient and perspective about our journey to how we got here.
