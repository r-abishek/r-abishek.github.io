The memoir is a stirring account of President Obama’s rise to his presidency. The book follows his early days, his life as a senator, his presidential campaign and the initial years in the White House. As mentioned in the introduction, it is indeed targeted at a younger audience who can learn from Obama’s past experiences and augment that knowledge with their own imagination of creating a better world. Considering Obama’s rather slower speech tempo, I loved listening to the narration at anywhere between 1.5-2.5x depending on the intensity of the content being delivered. Although, I must admit that I would every so often, listen to an interesting segment over again in 1x to entirely capture and appreciate his fluidity in thought, writing and speech. Obama’s accurate choice of words spoken with utmost gravitas and control, not to mention, in his typical mollifying tone was a real pleasure to listen to.

The book is a good long 27 chapters that are generally well classified. Starting out with a short a remembrance of his time as president and his walks in the the white house garden, the first couple of chapters begin with a description of his younger days, his fascinations with basketball, classic books and ideas for social change. Obama’s chronicles of his teenage life in Hawaii, becoming a community organizer in Chicago, his first considerations to run for public office and for the Illinois State Senate are all recollected in such surprisingly vivid detail after so many years, that they would in all likelihood, impress a patient reader/listener. Later in 2004, his big keynote at the **Democratic National Convention** that gave him national attention, would be most instrumental in brining him victory in the Senate race.

The next few chapters speak about his campaign for the US presidency, again in striking detail. <span class="spoiler">Some of his experiences/encounters with supporters and fans are highlighted well with commentary, and he voices his deep concern over all the racial animosity from vandalized Obama-signboards that he saw in Iowa during the campaign.</span> He reveals specifics about the picks he made for his white house team and his chief of staff including a recollection of the inauguration day and a possible terrorist threat to the event that he was aware of.

His presidency started out with essential political action that was necessary for **economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis in the US**. The deep dive into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was most interesting to me. Understanding the goals of this act in unemployment insurance, food assistance, improvise the transportation sector and other clean energy investments really gives the reader wider perspective into the kind of issues a president has to deal with after a recession.

Among his various state visits, Obama elaborates on his visit to India in 2010. <span class="spoiler">He reveals the fascinations he’s always had towards India and the profound effect Mahatma Gandhi had on his thoughts and way of life. He recalls the visit with Michelle to Mani Bhavan - Gandhi’s key Mumbai office for all political work. With interesting character sketches of Indian political leaders at the time based on his interactions, he offers commentary on the state of the religion, clan, and caste based ideas that still deeply influence the politics of the largest democracy in the world.</span>

The meticulously recounted details of geo-political events and issues during his presidency - like specific encounters with G20 leaders, BRICS leaders, working on global issues like climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, anti-terrorism, <span class="spoiler">dealing with the collapse of the Greek economy or an environmental disaster like the gulf of Mexico oil spill, working on closing the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison, the pivotal role of the US in the “Arab Spring” democratic uprisings against autocratic governments in Egypt and Libya,</span> and other recollections of trips to various countries around the world provide the reader with a true insider view into the life of a US president and were most captivating for me - more than the descriptions of local US politics.

Finally, Obama also talks about two of his most treasured and crowning achievements as president - the successful passing of the **Affordable Care Act** after an epic battle and constant efforts to muster up the necessary votes and secondly, the relentless efforts of the CIA since 9/11 that culminated in the **capture and killing Bin Laden**. On the whole, although “A Promised Land” is extremely verbose, providing readers with more detail than most would want, it is indeed most insightful, informative and inspiring to readers - as expected.
