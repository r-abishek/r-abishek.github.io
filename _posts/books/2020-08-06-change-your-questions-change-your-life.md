The book is an excellent collection of ideas and tools to improve and channelize your thoughts to improve productivity, reduce conflict among colleagues or partners. The book introduces the notion of question thinking - encouraging to ask positively reinforcing questions by means of a well guided story between a couple main characters. A deep dive into the whole learner vs judger mindset would help to analyze if you are in a perpetual state of curiosity and learning or in a state of judgment and self protection. The book also discusses techniques like q-storming, ABCC and encourages to strike the right balance between enquiry and advocacy (the number of questions you ask vs statements/answers you offer. A great short read!
