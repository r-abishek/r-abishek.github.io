The book provides an interesting perspective into the beginnings of the 21st century flat world by giving countless examples of outsourcing activities to India/China, and remote work across various global tech companies. The book is pretty verbose and the audio version feels more quite so, but it shared an interesting perspective by going back about 20 years in time and talking about the incremental flattening of the tech industry (listening in 2x helps for sure!). Friedman talks about the whole unplugged story of the creation of the internet and the World Wide Web from Netscape going public to PayPal to Salesforce and their strategies. Development of today's most used internet protocols like HTTP, HTML, TCP, IP, SMTP, POP, SSL, XML, SOAP, AJAX are discussed. Sections about different organizations' success stories like Google's introduction of the page rank algorithm, Walmartâ€™s supply chain genius, development of the open source / community developed software and the Apache foundation, successes of Napster and BitTorrent, examples of successes in the airline industry and e-commerce like Jet Blue, Ebay, Aramex and many more - although a little outdated for 2020/2021, give various insights into navigating across the flat world. Overall, the book encourages the new generation to be strategic optimists and embrace this change, keeping in mind the increased economic competition in the flat world that we live in today.
