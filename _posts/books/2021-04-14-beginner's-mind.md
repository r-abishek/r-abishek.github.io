Beginner’s mind is quite the distinctive kind of autobiography. It is a heartfelt musical memoir of the presidential medal of freedom and 18 time Grammy Award winner - musician and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. The audiobook offers short excerpts of Ma’s music on his cello at regular intervals or at the ends of chapters. I always marveled at his ability to succinctly deliver to a lay audience, a context, or the intended significance, or **the different possible interpretations of a piece of music before playing it to the listener.** This has a powerful effect on increasing the listener’s ability to **capture more emotion from the piece being played.** His unparalleled skills to produce such rich and resonant sound is well known, but listening to his music while he narrates his memoir was also quite the unique experience.

Ma speaks about the **importance of curiosity in life,** his struggles as an immigrant, influences that his personal and professional partnerships had on his music, and how traveling helped him see, that deep-rooted culture can capture the full range of human emotion. He elaborately talks about the Argentine tango composer - Astor Piazzolla, and interprets the silence at the end of some his music as a raw and chilling reminder to a period of longing and desperation, during hard times in 1970s Argentina. He follows this up with a catchy performance at the end of chapter 4 which I thought was the best musical excerpt in this audiobook.

In the fifth chapter, Ma talks about finding his identity. He mentions that his courses at Harvard in astronomy, evolutionary biology, literature and anthropology helped to get the tools to explore his true identity rather than just using a label like "musician”. <span class="spoiler">He says he had to go somewhere so far away from what he knew, in order to grasp something so fundamental about music and his role as a musician - and this would help him untangle the questions of identity that had been following him for so many decades. I felt that lessons from this chapter could be used in completely different scenarios too. His trips to Kalahari, Tel-Aviv, Petra and other inspirations led to ideas of a “Silk Road” project that would serve as an organizational platform to promote a multi-cultural exchange of ideas in music.</span> The musical piece at the end of the 5th chapter - ***“Rain falling from the roof”*** was most mesmerizing for me! A simple gentle progression of musical rain drops with a crescendo and decrescendo was somehow so delightfully engaging that it brought about a relaxed sensation, and with it, a seemingly new sense of purpose!

With a reference to the 2020 Netflix docudrama “The Social Dilemma”, Ma ends the memoir on a hopeful note suggesting listeners to strip away any preconceptions they might have, reduce focus on material objectives or monetary profits, and instead use core human values like truth, trust, service, curiosity and collaboration for the better good.
