The power of habit is quite a must read for all who want to get from “wannabe” to “achiever” - in terms of **developing a new habit or getting rid of one.** It’s not too long a read, and I can say that I factually learned quite a lot from this book, but it could have probably been shorter considering that it offers only one major idea thats presented in the first section of the book.

The book is quite well organized into three sections.

The first section talks about **how habits emerge in an individuals life, and how to make and change habits.** The neurology of a habit is also explained very well, by introducing the reader/listener to the “habit loop” which constitutes of the “Cue-Routine-Reward” cycle. <span class="spoiler">This involves the idea of separating a habit into its three constituents - A “cue” that serves as a trigger, the “routine” that is the action followed through in the habit, and the “reward” associated with performing the routine. The book suggests that the best way to change an existing habit, is to understand the cue and reward associated with it very well and just swap out the routine to something that would give you a similar reward.</span> This “golden rule of habit change” is immensely emphasized and is pretty much the main ideology and the key takeaway from this book.

The next section gives **numerous examples of how habit changes have influenced the successes in various organizations** including successes of Claude Hopkins in advertising for the Pepsodent toothpaste in the 1900s and creating a tooth-brushing habit among millions of people! <span class="spoiler">It was quite interesting to learn that it wasn’t the cleanliness of teeth that Claude Hopkins sold in Pepsodent. It was the cool tingling sensation that was sold as a subtle play on the user’s mind. This feeling of freshness in the mouth was unconsciously leading millions to people to changing their routines, who started putting Pepsodent toothpaste as the big routine-centerpiece in their brushing habit loop.</span>

The book elaborates on the pivotal role that the “cue-routine-reward” habit loop plays/played in innumerable cases including -
- how “habit-loop” based marketing strategies by **Quaker oats** got them to where they are today.
- how the departmental store - **Target**, uses mathematical models to generate “guest portraits” of their shoppers <span class="spoiler">in order to always know what you want before you do - by simply conducting a thorough pattern analysis on the data collected from shoppers’ buying patterns, revealing their habits.</span>
- how **radio stations** introducing new songs in between two familiar songs, strategically takes advantage of the golden rule of habit change - introduction of a new routine into the cue-routine-reward loop.
- how Bill Wilson understood the habit loop, resulting in the founding of **Alcoholics Anonymous** - an organization emphasizing the 12 steps to achieving sobriety.
- how the power of habit helped **Michael Phelps**, when water seeped into his swimming glasses during the Beijing Olympics.
- how a high school dropout substance addict understood the habit loop to become a successful manager at **Starbucks.**
- how the idea of **food journaling** ensures you understand your cues and rewards associated with overeating and helps you change the routine to eat more healthy.
- how one of the biggest success stories in the manufacturing and Aluminum industry - **Alcoa** - was based on the idea of identifying and disrupting a keystone habit in a company, that lead to a cascading effect on all other dependent habits, significantly improving the safety standards of the company and taking it to new heights.

The author introduces us to a couple of famous experiments like the the **Stanford Marshmallow Experiment** on 4 year old kids elaborating on the ability to exercise self control. The extremely compelling Eugene Pauly experiment and the **Graybiel experiments** on lab-rats at MIT, show us the influence of the basal ganglia (in our brains) in chunking and formation of habits.

The third and final section of the book takes a look at **the habits of whole societies.** Offering examples from the Montgomery bus boycott in the 1950s and Saddleback Valley Church in Southern California one of the most interesting conceptions of societal change on a large scale is explored. <span class="spoiler">The author says - “Movements don’t emerge because everyone suddenly decides to face the same direction at once. They rely on social patterns that begin as the habits of friendship, grow through the habits of communities, and are sustained by new habits that change participants’ sense of self.” Historical events like the Montgomery bus boycott starting out a huge wave of new habits in the civil rights movement provide validation to the above claim.</span>

The book ends by suggesting a first step to isolate and bucket the reasons for your habit urges into one of **5 categories - Location / Time / Emotional state / Other people around you / Immediately preceding action** in order to help understand the “cue” in the habit loop. It encourages the notion that we are the ones who are in control of our own habits offering these diverse examples of successes, many of which I didn’t know about. Overall, the book is a great knowledge-augmenter revolving around one key idea.
