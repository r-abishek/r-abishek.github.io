Kenmore Air is a 75 year old charter seaplane / land aircraft service with destinations in the Lake Union / Lake Washington areas, to Friday Harbor, San Juan Islands, Victoria/Vancouver British Columbia and others. We've done the Kenmore Air San Juan Islands flight from this Lake Washington location, and the Seattle Scenic Seaplane Tour from their SLU (South Lake Union) location.

The San Juan Islands tour is longer and definitely worth it for a group of 10 people where you can reserve a whole seaplane (9 seats + 1 co-pilot seat). We had an experienced ex Boeing777 pilot taking us around in a **de Havilland DHC-3 Otter**, and he was kind enough to answer all our questions. The route takes you right over Union Bay, Portage Bay, Lake Union and the Salmon Bay into Puget Sound constantly maintaining about a 1000ft offering fantastic aerial views of Seattle, Kirkland, Bellevue, all the way till Whidbey Island, Port Townsend, Anacortes and the San Juan Islands.

After flying the Kenmore Air livery sea planes in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, a first sea-plane 'co-piloting' experience in real life was most enjoyable!
