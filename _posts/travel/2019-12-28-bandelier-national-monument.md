The Bandelier National Monument is an absolutely unique experience that takes you on a time machine back to the 1100s. We visited in the winter, so had great weather to walk and climb up ladders to get inside these **cliff-dwellings of the Native American Anasazi or Puebloan people**. It was quite an educative experience learning about Puebloan culture, and the life of these people along the **Frijoles Canyon**, before they started to spread out along the banks of the Rio Grande.

These rare sights of ceremonial **kivas**, **petroglyphs** carved into rocks, and **dwellings** (basically entire homes carved into rock cliffs) was supremely stimulating! A highly recommended outdoor activity if visiting Santa Fe!
