The **Hoh River Trail**, **Hall of Mosses Trail** and the **Spruce Trail** are all must-do walks since they each have their own charm and aspects to learn from. Most trees in the Olympic Peninsula are **Sitka Spruce** or **Western Hemlock** or **Douglas Firs**. There are plenty of examples of these trees here. The trails also take you through a little climb to show the emergent, canopy, understory, and forest floor of a rainforest. It was my first time visiting a rainforest, and all the trails here surely had the most refreshing experiences - may it be of being surrounded by ferns in all directions, or the just the sweet smell of fresh grass and the endemic flora that have been satiated with plenty of rain.

During peak seasons (May - Sep), even if there is a 2hr long car-wait in the road leading up to the trail and Hoh Rainforest Visitor Center, its still a pretty nice experience once you get there!
