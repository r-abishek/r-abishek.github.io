This is surely an interesting national monument to stop by, to satiate your desire to actually see a petroglyphs from the 1300s in real life. Over **20,000 petroglyphs** by Native American Pueblo people are supposedly present along the **Boca-Negra Canyon** area and along the Rio Grande river at the base of the Sandia Mountains. They contain thousands of messages and sketches showing animal/human depictions and other symbols.

The trails at this national monument taking visitors to the top of the mesa give a good glimpse of these. Got to understand the key differences between petroglyphs and hieroglyphs here!
