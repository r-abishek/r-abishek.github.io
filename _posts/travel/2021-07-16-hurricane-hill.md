One of the most mesmerizing panoramic snow-capped-peak views you might see in a lifetime!

We visited hurricane ridge visitor center on July 1 and did the hike to the top of hurricane hill in the 4:30pm-6:30pm time frame. Got a great view of **Mt Olympus** which is usually masked behind a thick cloud cover, along with deer and black bear sightings, and lots of wild flowers. The 3-3.5 mile round trip will definitely make your day!
