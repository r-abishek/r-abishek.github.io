After hiking down from the South Rim, we did a 12 mile day-hike to Ribbon Falls from Phantom Ranch and back, following the North Kaibab Trail. The hike is well worth it if you have an extra night to spend at Phantom Ranch before heading back to the South Rim.

The trail takes you up in the direction of the North Rim upto an elevation difference of about 2000 feet. Since the entire stretch is along the Bright Angel Creek, that in itself offers a different kind of experience. Cacti are plentiful with an assortment of various other flora on the trail. Its more green, and less rocky when compared to the south rim-to-river trails.
