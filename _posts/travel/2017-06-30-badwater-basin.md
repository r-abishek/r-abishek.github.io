A drive from the bay area to Vegas warrants a visit to Death Valley National Park, and the Badwater basin should surely be on the bucket list! This is a long due review since I've been here more than a couple times now, and the walk on Badwater basin has never disappointed. Visiting here always gives the vibes of unadulterated desolation - being dropped on the moon or another planet where you are completely surrounded by a whole lot of nothingness! Thats the most unique experience here, other than a few bonus add-ons:
- experiencing temperatures a few degrees off the highest ever recorded on this planet (**134 deg F at Furnace Creek in 1913**) - we were able to check off 127 deg F in July
- or walking on the lowest salty dry land in North America **85.5 meters below sea level**, which is intriguing in itself.
Definitely worth the time!
