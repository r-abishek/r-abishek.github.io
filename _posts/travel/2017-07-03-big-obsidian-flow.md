The central and western United States have quite many places where Obsidian can be found, but this stretch in Oregon particularly has a huge concentration. Coming across volcanic glass as **"obsidian gravel"** in minecraft or **"dragonglass"** from game of thrones was cool, but it is quite fascinating to see this kind of rock actually in-person! A great middle-ages educational pit-stop hike if driving on 97!
