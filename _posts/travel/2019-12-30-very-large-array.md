We visited the VLA during the end of 2019 right before COVID-19 hit, and being an amateur astronomer, I found it to be an illuminating experience! They had a guided tour taking us to the bottom of one of the **28 huge 80 feet wide dishes** and talking about its working. They also took us to the control room where incoming data is monitored and the telescopes direction and angle are changed from. They have a 30-40 seat presentation room and a store at the visitor center. With a little bit of a detour, it makes a nice educative stop on the way from Albuquerque to ElPaso.
