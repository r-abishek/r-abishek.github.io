The Arches National Park is known to have the largest concentration of natural sandstone arches, and a visit to the park in December was indeed cold, but still rewarded us with wondrously memorable sights of some of the most singular sandstone formations anywhere in the world.

Sweeping views of the little white fluffy patches of snow sitting atop contrasting bright brown-red sandstone rocks against a clear blue sky background was quite the unique winter-special panorama on the menu. A scenic drive through the park and short walks on a couple of popular trails are in itself quite rewarding. The Balanced Rock, Delicate Arch, Landscape Arch and others were some of the must-dos that we hit.

The evolution story of these ‘arch’ and ‘wall’ formations was remarkably fascinating! Most of the 2000 odd arches found in this park are apparently a result of nature’s incessant cycle of deposition, uplifting, collapse and erosion. Put simply, my understanding is:
- **Deposition** of salt on this land, thousands of feet deep, was due to an evaporated sea.
- Debris from erosion of surrounding mountains simply kept settling over this salt bed **pressuring** the salt to squeeze its way through into a long and deep fault, which was completely covered above with sand and debris, which over time became sandstone and rock.
- The pressurized salt in this large fault eventually formed a huge number of long parallel cracks due to zonal land **uplifting and sinking**.
- As anyone might expect, water starts and ends this story. Water found its way through little fractures and crevices into these larger faults and dissolved the salt causing the support-less rock/sandstone above to **collapse due to erosion**.

The remnants of the collapse are what we see today as these spectacular arches, and learning about these rare sequence of geological events was the most intriguing part of the experience.
