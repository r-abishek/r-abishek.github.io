Thereâ€™s no out-and-out "complete" way to experience the natural beauty of the Grand canyon, but taking the **9.5 mile hike** on the Bright Angel Trail, from the South Rim all the way down to Phantom Ranch most definitely comes close enough! The hike rewards you with perennially spectacular views of every period of geological evolution in the Paleozoic era from about **250 to 550 million** years ago.

The first time experience on this trail is just supremely mesmerizing with views of the landscape and rocks changing with **every 15 minutes of hike**. The complete hike to Phantom Ranch from the Bright Angel Trailhead basically takes you down by a significant 4400 feet of elevation, and an astronomically more significant >300 million years back in time. Walking down the natural **"Grand-Staircase"** layer by layer, over such a wide range of rocks from:
- **Kaibab** and **Toroweap** Limestones at the South Rim (270Ma),
- **Coconino/Hermit/Supai** Sandstones (275Ma),
- **Redwall/Muav** Limestones (340Ma),
- **Tapeats** Sandstone (525Ma), and finally
- **Granite Vishnu basement** rocks (550-1700Ma)

in under 10 miles is extremely rare and at the same quite an enlightening and educative experience!

Getting to the Bright Angel Trail Bridge to finally cross the Colorado river on foot was most rewarding followed by a short hike to Phantom Ranch on the north banks of the river. Plenty of water, electrolytes, snack bars, fruits, nuts are highly recommended. There are rest stops at every 1.5 miles on the trail with toilet, seasonal water and emergency services.
