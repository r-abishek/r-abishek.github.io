Going down the South Kaibab trail all the way to Phantom Ranch was a contrastingly unique experience even after going down the Bright Angel trail to get to Phantom Ranch the previous year. Counter-intuitively, this trail isn’t the same or even remotely similar to the Bright Angel trail at least for the first three quarters of the hike down. The length and elevation difference for the hike to Phantom Ranch is about **7 miles / 4800 feet** as opposed to the **9.5 miles / 4400 feet** while taking the Bright Angel trail. We saw most distinctive and exclusive views which aren’t visible from the Bright Angel trail including sweeping panoramas that span significantly wider and further just due to the fact that this trial follows a high ridge-line unlike others that drop straight down sometimes resulting in losing your line of sight on the farther landscape. The other most distinctive view was an aerial sight of the river thats a little harder to get with the Bright Angel Trail. There are rest stops at 1.5 and 3 miles on the trail but no water services.

That being said, going down both trails were personally once in a lifetime hikes and surely make the list to the most rewarding nature-travel experiences.
