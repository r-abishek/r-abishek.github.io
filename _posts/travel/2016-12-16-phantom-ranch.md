Phantom Ranch is a super-extremely-limited-availability NPS-run dorm/cabin/canteen service at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. A stay there for a night or two is just an unfathomably mind refreshing experience, especially if you end up there on your 25th birthday:)! I was lucky enough to be there twice around August and November and the weather was most conducive for the long rim-to-river hike (either by Bright Angel Trail or by the South Kaibab Trail) and stay there both times.

We planned to get down there anywhere between 3-5pm which is ideal since it gives the right amount of time for a quick checkin/refresh/nap followed by an early supper. The food is served in family-style at the main canteen, and after a long tiring hike, anyone would savor their absolutely delicious vegetarian chilli, salad, corn bread and chocolate dessert like never before!

Post dinner, National Park Service rangers organize bottom-of-the-canyon ranger-talks, which are most educative. We heard a fascinating one about **California Condors**!
Breakfast is served early for hikers heading out, or in our case we spent the day hiking up to Ribbon Falls which is a perfect day-trip from Phantom Ranch.
