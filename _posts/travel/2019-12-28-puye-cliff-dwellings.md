Classified as a national historic landmark, the Puye Cliff Dwellings are the ancestral homes of the Santa Clara Indians who lived there for about **300 years between 1200-1500**. The people currently living in the **Pueblo of Santa Clara** are supposedly the descendants of the ancient Puye people from the 1200s and continue to speak Tewa, their native language.

These homes are similar to the Bandelier National Monument in many ways, but they still do have their own unique cave dwellings that are different from those at Bandelier.

It was interesting to see how people in the 1200s could construct cave dwellings (can probably call them little "sandstone cliff apartments" in modern tongue) that are cut into the cliff face of a hill all the way up to the mesa-top just using stone knives, arrowheads and the kind of tools available at that time!

There are tours available to drive visitors to the mesa top dwellings, and then hike/walk/climb/scramble down the cliff accompanied by a tour guide while they talk about the dwellings on the cliff itself. Recommend visiting Puye and Bandlier both.
