We had an absolutely unforgettable experience being one of the first visitors to the newest member of the US National Park family. White Sands was upgraded to a National Park on Dec 20 2019, we ended up visiting the very next day on the 21st - enroute from Albuquerque to El Paso and it was totally worth it!

The Alkali Flat trail is towards the end of the road-access, and takes you deep within the **beaming-white gypsum sand dunes** - a sight that's extremely rare. Gypsum is a common mineral and its deposits are found in lakes and hot springs, but since gypsum easily dissolves in water, it makes it extremely hard to find such a large concentration of fine gypsum sand crystals anywhere else on the planet, which is what makes this place special!

Sleds are available from the White Sands Visitor Center for rent and purchase, and the sledding is super fun to do considering that the sand is extremely dry, loose and height of the dunes go up to even **50 feet in height!** Highly recommend the park and this specific trail!

Warning: Do not sled with car keys in pocket :) Losing a rental car's keys and calling AAA to a middle-of-nowhere national park did contribute a bit to the degree-of-unforgettability of our winter experience!
