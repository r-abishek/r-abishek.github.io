A walk down Canyon Road was one of the highlights of our trip to Santa Fe and Albuquerque in New Mexico. Personally, for someone who appreciates art and color, this 3-4 hr walk was an absolutely inspiring, educative and invigorating experience. The artists here are overwhelmingly friendly and eager to dispense their know-how during interactions. Easily got to learn about 20 different art/craft-forms that I didn't know about - from **southwest Indian Pueblo pottery**, kinetic wind sculptures, tons of oil on canvases, pastel work, stunningly colorful **kiln-fired cracked-ceramic** artwork, **unique patinas** from heating, oxidation and controlled chemical reactions, different types of copper and bronze sculptures, **art using unique alluring geodes**, and other Native American painting styles. A super cool experience!
